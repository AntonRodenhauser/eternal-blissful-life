Iâ€™m Anton Rodenhauser, 25, and live in Berlin, where I did my Bachelor in Physics and currently do my master in Scientific Computing.

I created this website to share my vision for the future and my philosophy of life. I hope you get something out of it!

Besides science &amp; technology my interests include everything regarding how the human brain works, and psychology . In particular I focus a lot on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[overcoming biases](http://www.overcomingbias.com/about)</span> like confirmation bias (and yesâ€¦ also wishful thinking!) and other cognitive fallacies.

I am also part of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) </span>movement, which in my view is the best starting point if you want to take part in the quest to enable an (eternal?!) blissful life for every sentient being.

I am a huge fan of Tim Urbans Blog <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/).</span> I probably owe it to his post <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Religion for Nonreligious](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html)</span> that I started seriously thinking about my own spirituality and eventually came up with all the ideas presented on this website. Thanks Tim!

It is my dearest wish for everyone in this beautiful universe to be blissful now and eventually be blissful forever.

Berlin, 2018
